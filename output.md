    pageContent: "Main Faqs\n\nWhat programming languages and frameworks does the platform cover?\nOur Frontend Developer Career Path uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript before moving on to React.\nWe also have an AI Engineering Path aimed at devs who want to learn about implementing AI solutions. \n\nDoes the platform offer project-based learning where I can build real-world projects?\nYes. All of our projects use real-world examples and all of our learning is project based.\n\nWhat is the format of the courses?\nOur courses use interactive scrims. A scrim is both a video player and a code editor. When you pause the video, you can edit the code the teach was working on. It’s really cool and you have to try it to believe it.\n\nDoes the platform offer live classes or is it self-paced?\nAll of our courses are streamed on demand, so it’s self-paced. We do have a weekly Townhall meet up on Discord and Bootcamp students have online meetings at fixed times.",

It’s important to be active, post daily, and be sure to join our weekly sessions. The more you get involved, the more you’ll benefit from it and get the most out of your Bootcamp learning experience.\n\nCommon study group posts to help you stay on track: \n\nWeekly learning commitments (”This week I will...”)\nDaily check-ins (”Today I will... ”)\nShare takeaways and highlights about what you’re learning &amp; building\nLearning challenges and wins\nKey takeaways or highlights from your code reviews",

To best understand and answer your question, you should explain the problem with as much detail as possible, what you’ve tried so far, and - if possible - share a link to your code or the lesson that you have questions about.\nYou may also schedule a 1-1 call with a mentor or teacher to discuss coding questions and walk through it with screen sharing.
